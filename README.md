# ISE362-Stochastic-Models-in-IE

This repository will contain the Python codes and maybe slides that I am developing to teach ISE362 in the Spring semester. 
For now, I have only uploaded a Python code for a simple MDP, that solve calculates the utility of each state and publishes the best policy for each. 
More on the way...
